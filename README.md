This sleep tracker application is made to allow users to trsck their sleep schedule every night, you can lock the date and amount you slept so that you can track your progress and see how many hours you are sleeping.
I used the ai grok to help me make the app, the description i gave it was :
Create a sleep tracker application for easy personal use 
Home page should allow users to input the amount of hours they slept in a night 
Should also have a tab where it shows the amount of sleep they wanted to get that night and if they achieved it 
Should all be on one page 
Include bootstrap CDN and the bootstrapwatch.com vapor theme. Include navigation 
All data should be stored in JSON format 
Login is not required
